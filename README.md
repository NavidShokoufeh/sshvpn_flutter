# Usage

## Setting up the VPN

To configure the VPN connection, use the setup method and pass an SSHServer instance with the required configuration:

```dart
import 'package:sshvpn_flutter/sshvpn_flutter.dart';

final sshVpnFlutterPlugin = SshvpnFlutter();

    SSHServer server = SSHServer(
      host: hostNameController.text,
      port: int.parse(
          sslPortController.text.isEmpty ? '443' : sslPortController.text),
      username: userNameController.text,
      password: passController.text,
      udpgw: udpgwController.text,
      udpgwPort: int.parse(
          udpgwPortController.text.isEmpty ? '7300' : udpgwPortController.text),
      iosConfiguration: SSHIOSConfiguration(
        enableMSCHAP2: true,
        enableCHAP: false,
        enablePAP: false,
        enableTLS: false,
      ),
    );
    await sshVpnFlutterPlugin.setup(server: server);
```

## Connecting to VPN

To connect to the VPN:
```dart
await sshVpnFlutterPlugin.connect();
```

## Disconnecting from VPN

To disconnect from the VPN:
```dart
await sshVpnFlutterPlugin.disconnect();
```

## Checking Connection Status

To get the last known VPN connection status:
```dart
String status = await sshVpnFlutterPlugin.lastStatus() ?? 'disconnected'
print('Last VPN status: $status');
```

# Limitations

- **Platform:** This plugin is only supported on iOS. Android support is not currently available.
